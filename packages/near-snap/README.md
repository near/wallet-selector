## Known Issues

Currently, the Near Snap and Coin98 Wallet conflict each other since the Coin98 overrides the `window.ethereum` to avoid this try the following:

- Through the "Override Wallet" feature on Coin98 Extension (Home > Settings > Override Wallet). Turning off the button means allowing the other wallet to override Coin98 and vice versa.
- Through Chrome's "Manage Extensions" section > Deactivate Coin98 when wishing to use other wallets.
